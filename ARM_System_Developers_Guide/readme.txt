To build these examples:

1. Ensure that you have the ARM ADS1.1 toolkit installed and that
armcc, armasm and armlink are available from the command line.

2. Change directory into the subdirectory with build files
'makefile' and 'build.bat'. For example type 'cd ch05_C' for
the examples of chapter 5.

3. On a unix or linux system type 'make'. This will make the makefile.

4. On a windows system type 'build'. This will run the build script
build.bat.
